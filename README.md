Ludwig provides a framework for generating the linearized Boltzmann collision operator for electron-electron scattering in two-dimensional materials and materials with a pseudo-two-dimensional band structure. This package also provides utilities for calculating conductivities and viscosities of the electron fluid from the generated collision matrix.

The authors of this package are [Davis Thuillier](https://github.com/DavisThuillier) and Thomas Scaffidi.
